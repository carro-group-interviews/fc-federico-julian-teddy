# React challenge

There are two challenges:

1. [Code Test](./code-test/), during interview, you'll be given time limit, around 1 hour. During which you'll demonstrate your coding abilities by completing the assignment on [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com) or codepen. You will take the test on-screen. Once the time is up, we'll review your code about 1 hour or less, and then we'll continue our interview and you'll have to explain how you completed given tasks.

2. [Take Home](./take-home/), you can take this off-screen and finish the assignment within given days, typically 1-3 days depending on your experience.
